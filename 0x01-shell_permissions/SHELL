te:: go through the materials before reading this.. this is meant to guide you if you've run out of options....

If you ask me a question contained in any of the resources I'll simply redirect you there no offence.. RTFM
Note:: you are not creating a new repository for this task you would be working on the alx-system-engineering devops you created yesterday..

cd into alx-system-engineering devops
mkdir 0x01-shell_permissions
Cd into 0x01
Create a README.md file 

Then proceed and do your tasks..
